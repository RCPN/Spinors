# Spinors
A series of two arcticles published for the University of Sydney Physics Society magazine "Jeremy".

The Mobius transformations representing rotations of the Riemann sphere about the x, y, and z axes derived in the second article can be plotted using [David Bau's Conformal Map Viewer](http://davidbau.com/archives/2013/02/10/conformal_map_viewer.html):

- [R<sub>x</sub>(ζ;θ)](http://davidbau.com/conformal/#(cos(4pi*t%2F2)z%2Bi*sin(4pi*t%2F2))%2F(i*sin(4pi*t%2F2)z%2Bcos(4pi*t%2F2)))
- [R<sub>y</sub>(ζ;θ)](http://davidbau.com/conformal/#(cos(pi*t)z%2Bsin(pi*t))%2F(-sin(pi*t)z%2Bcos(pi*t)))
- [R<sub>z</sub>(ζ;θ)](http://davidbau.com/conformal/#e%5E(i*4pi*t)*z)

Note that the slider for the angle only takes values between 0 and 1, so a correction factor of 4π has been included to increase the range of angles to between 0 and 4π. This ensures that two full rotations are animated, corresponding to one full rotation of the spinor representation.
